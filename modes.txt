RoboMX channel commands (RoboMX 0.5)


Channel modes can be set from the server-console or from channel operators

usage:

/mode +t

+ adds the option, - removes the option.

list of channel available options:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+t  : means "topic". If this is set, then only operators can change the topic. 
          /mode +t
      
+k  : A channel set +k requires a keyword to enter. A key may contain printable 
      and non printable characters. 
          /mode +k <key>
          /mode -k <key>

+m  : If you set the channel +m, then only operators or people who an operator has set 
      +v can talk on channel. This is a useful way of dealing with an attack by floodbots.

+e  : In a channel set +e operators can exile users to another room (/exile <user>... see below)
          /mode +e <targetroom>
          /mode -e 

+v  : The +v mode simply gives someone on a +m channel permission to send text to the channel, 
      even if he or she is not an op. (All ops automatically have permission to speak.)

+o  : The +o mode is set or unset for particular users. Making a user +o gives the user 
      operator status on the channel. Making a user -o removes operator status
	  /mode +o <user>
	  /mode -o <user>

+l  : This sets a limit on the number of people that can join the channel. This mode does not 
      really guarantee that no more than the set number of people will be on channel. 
      For instance, setting this mode does not kick anyone off if the channel is over the limit. 

+b  : This bands a user from the channel. Note: the ban is IP based and not nickname based.
	  /mode +b <user>
	  /mode -b <user>

+p  : If you set a channel +p operators can mark users as troll. They will have a prefix in front
      of their name.
         /mode +p <prefix>
         /mode -p

+i  : The +i mode is set or unset for particular users. Making a user +i will mark him/her as a 
      'troll' in a channel set +p. All messages from this users will have the prefix [Troll]_.
         /mode +i <user>
         /mode -i <user>

+c  : /mode -c disables colored text support for a user. /mode +c enables it. Every user can 
      use this command. It only changes the settings for the user that uses it.
